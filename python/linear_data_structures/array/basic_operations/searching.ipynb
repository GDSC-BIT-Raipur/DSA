    " The \"best\" searching algorithm depends on the specific context and requirements of the search problem. Different algorithms have different strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of algorithm often depends on factors like the size of the dataset, the nature of the data, and the trade-off between time complexity and space complexity. Here are a few commonly used searching algorithms and their characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Search**: This is the simplest searching algorithm, where each element in the list is checked one by one until the target element is found or the list is exhausted. It works well for small datasets, but its time complexity is O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of elements in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Binary Search**: Binary search is highly efficient but requires a sorted list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It has a time complexity of O(log n), making it suitable for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hashing**: Hashing involves mapping keys to indices in an array using a hash function. If implemented properly, hash-based searching can have an average-case time complexity of O(1), making it extremely fast. However, handling collisions and choosing a good hash function can be challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Note** : Must checkout hashing if want to search in unsorted array\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Jump Search**: Jump search is similar to binary search but works on a sorted block of data. It jumps ahead by a fixed number of steps, and when a value greater than the target is found, it performs a linear search within the block. It combines aspects of linear and binary search algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Interpolation Search**: This algorithm works best for uniformly distributed sorted datasets. It estimates the position of the target element based on its value and the distribution of the data, which can result in faster convergence than binary search for some datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Exponential Search**: Exponential search is especially useful when the target element lies towards the beginning of a sorted list. It involves doubling the search range until an interval containing the target element is found, and then performing a binary search within that interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Ternary Search**: Ternary search is similar to binary search but divides the dataset into three parts instead of two. It can be effective in cases where the data has a \"peak\" or \"valley\" pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Fibonacci Search**: This is a variant of binary search that divides the dataset into Fibonacci-number-sized subarrays. It can be useful for large datasets where the size is not known in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"best\" algorithm depends on your specific use case. For example, if you have a small dataset, a linear search might be sufficient. If you have a large sorted dataset, binary search or interpolation search could be more appropriate. If you have a hash table available, hashing might provide fast access. Always consider the characteristics of your data and the requirements of your search when selecting an algorithm.\n",
